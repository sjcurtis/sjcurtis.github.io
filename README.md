## Software Design and Engineering
This artifact is a rewrite of an inventory application for Android rewritten in .NET. I selected this application because it covers a lot of the course outcomes. The biggest areas are software engineering techniques and communication. This artifact also demonstrates some security aspects. The artifact demonstrates database design and integration, and I used Entity Framework to accomplish this. Entity Framework is also a popular method to integrate with MVC and will look good in a portfolio. Using MVC helps separate logic from models and views and pushes it into the controller.

I met the course objectives that I planned out. The readme demonstrates the ability to communicate project information to other developers. Security is demonstrated by requiring users to register and login. Inventory is also tied to the user who created it. Using MVC and Entity Framework are modern approaches to develop web-based solutions. MVC allows logic to be separated and can be used in larger teams. 

.NET isn’t new to me, but I am a bit rusty. The biggest challenge, I usually face, is setting up Entity Framework using a code first approach. It takes time to get the models and code setup to be able to start doing database migrations. Once everything is linked together and the first database migration works then it’s easy to start adding enhancements.
